Here’s what you want to see in the card’s content window (modal):

Title

Displayed only in the header of the modal window.
Should not appear in the main content/body area.
Content/Body

Only the main body of the poem or text.
The title (first line) should be removed from the content.
The date and location (usually the last two lines) should also be removed from the content.
No extra blank lines at the top or bottom.
The content should be clean, showing only the actual poem or text, without metadata.
Footer

At the bottom of the modal, display the date and location.
These should be sourced from the artwork’s metadata (not from the content text itself).
The date should be formatted (e.g., “October 5, 2025”).
The location should be shown after the date, separated by a dash or similar.
Summary:

The modal header shows the title.
The modal body shows only the main content (no title, date, or location).
The modal footer shows the date and location from metadata.
This ensures the user sees a clean, non-redundant presentation: title at the top, content in the middle, and date/location at the bottom.
